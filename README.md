# Selenium Web Automation Test Framework

This is a C# Web automation test framework powered by [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) and [SpecFlow](http://specflow.org/). 

## Selenium
With Selenium you can create robust, browser-based regression automation suites and tests. Most of time, Selenium is quite straightforward: Find an element and perform an operation on it. Writing test scripts with Selenium WebDriver is much more than knowing the API; it involves programming, HTML, JavaScript, and web browsers.

## SpecFlow
SpecFlow is the official Cucumber implementation for .NET.  Behavior Driven Development (BDD) with SpecFlow provide a understandable communication method to people (Business Analyst, Test Analyst and Developer). 

## Automation Test Framework Features
 - Decouple Selenium test framework from business logical and test case. 
 - Provide an out-of-the-box automation test capability. So that testers can build up a test project for a new web application very quickly. 
 - With ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core Data Access enable back end verification. In most of cases verifying test result from database is more effective and efficient. You can choose Entity Framework, Database Management Systems or any other options to access database.
 - Use SpecFlow to create features and scenarios.
